Blocks ads on Facebook, Youtube and all other websites.","fullDescription":"AdGuard ad blocker effectively blocks all types of ads on all web pages, even on Facebook, YouTube, and others!\n\nWhat AdGuard ad blocker does:\n\n1. Blocks all ads: video ads (including YouTube video ads), rich media advertising, unwanted pop-ups, banners and text ads (including Facebook advertisements);\n2. Speeds up page loading and saves bandwidth, thanks to the missing ads and pop up windows;\n3. Blocks many spyware, adware, and dialer installers;\n4. Protects your privacy by blocking common third-party tracking systems;\n5. Protects you from malware and phishing.\n\nHow can AdGuard ad blocker protect your privacy?\n\nJust enable Tracking Protection filter in AdGuard settings. It completely removes all forms of tracking from the Internet. AdGuard has one of the largest tracker filters containing more than 5,000 rules.\n\nHow to remove social media with AdGuard?\n\nTired of all the «Like» buttons and similar widgets infesting all of your frequented web pages? Just enable AdGuard \"Social media filter\" and forget about them.\n\nHow can AdGuard ad blocker protect you from online threats?\n\nAt the moment we’ve got more than 2,000,000 harmful websites on record. AdGuard can block domains known to spread malware, protecting your computer against viruses, Trojan horses, worms, spyware, and adware. AdGuard really lowers the risk of virus infections and prohibits access to harmful websites to prevent potential attacks.\n\nWhy does AdGuard require permissions?\n\n    Access your data for all websites and Access browser tabs: both permissions are necessary for AdGuard to apply all kinds of cosmetic processing to the pages content. Naive ad blocking would simply block ad servers, and leave broken elements and first-party ads on the pages. AdGuard applies special cosmetic rules to make pages look clean and tidy.\n    Access browser activity during navigation: this permission is necessary to keep track of navigation events in order to apply rules when the time is right.\n\n\n==============================\n\nRelease notes:\nhttps://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardBrowserExtension/releases\n\n==============================\n\nFree and Open Source:\nhttps://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardBrowserExtension\n\n==============================\n\nFound a bug?

The Google Container extension helps you take control and isolate your web activity from Google.","fullDescription":"THIS IS NOT AN OFFICIAL ADDON FROM MOZILLA! It is a fork of the Facebook Container addon.\n\nWhat does it do?\nGoogle Container works by isolating your Google identity into a separate container that makes it harder for Google to track your visits to other websites with third-party cookies.\n\nHow does it work?\nInstalling this extension deletes your Google cookies and logs you out of Google.\nThe next time you navigate to Google it will load in a new red colored browser tab (the “Container”).\nYou can log in and use Google normally when in the Google Container. If you click on a non-Google link or navigate to a non-Google website in the URL bar, these pages will load outside of the container.\nClicking Google Share buttons on other browser tabs will load them within the Google Container. You should know that using these buttons passes information to Google about the website that you shared from.\n\nWhich website features will not function?\nBecause you will be logged into Google only in the Container, embedded Google comments and Like buttons in tabs outside the Google Container will not work. This prevents Google from associating information about your activity on websites outside of Google to your Google identity.\n\nIn addition, websites that allow you to create an account or log in using your Google credentials will generally not work properly. Because this extension is designed to separate Google use from use of other websites, this behavior is expected.\n\nWhat does Google Container NOT protect against?\nIt is important to know that this extension doesn’t prevent Google from mishandling the data that it already has, or permitted others to obtain, about you. Google still will have access to everything that you do while you are on google.com.\n\nRather than stop using a service you find valuable, we think you should have tools to limit what data others can obtain. This extension focuses on limiting Google tracking, but other ad networks may try to correlate your Google activities with your regular browsing. In addition to this extension, you can change your Google settings, use Private Browsing, enable Tracking Protection, block third-party cookies, and/or use Firefox Multi-Account Containers extension to further limit tracking.\n\nWe do never collect any data, all the data we see, you see.\n\nOther Containers\nGoogle Container leverages the Containers feature that is already built in to Firefox. When you enable Google Container, you may also see Containers named Personal, Work, Shopping, and Banking while you browse. If you wish to use multiple Containers, you’ll have the best user experience if you install the Firefox Firefox Multi-Account Containers extension. You should also check out Temporary Containers .\n\nNOTE: If you are a Firefox Multi-Account Containers user who has already assigned Google to a Container, this extension will not work. In an effort to preserve your existing Container set up and logins, this add-on will not include the additional protection to keep other sites out of your Google Container. If you would like this additional protection, first unassign google.com in the Multi-Account Container extension, and then install this extension.\n\nRecommended privacy enhancing Add-ons\n\n    Decentraleyes:  Protects you against tracking through “free”, centralized, content delivery by automatically injecting local resources if possible.\n    Don’t track me google : If your search-engine of choice happens to be Google this Add-on will remove the tracking automatically placed on result-links. Or just use startpage.com instead.\n    HTTPS Everywhere:  Automatically redirects you to the secure version of websites if available.\n    Request Control: Lets you filter session, ref, utm and more query parameters from URLs and can also circumvent outgoing trackers on websites\n    uBlock Origin  I guess you already know this one. If not, check it out.","weeklyDownloads":144,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"containers-everywhere","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/13787351/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[],"contributionURL":"","averageRating":4.2222,"reviewCount":82,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/google-container/reviews/","updateDate":1614809122000},{"id":"{74fc443d-ab0b-42b2-95d0-890f2d8092cb}","icons":{"32":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/1016/1016760-32.png?modified=9d2bfa54","64":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/1016/1016760-64.png?modified=9d2bfa54","128":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/1016/1016760-128.png?modified=9d2bfa54"},"name":"HTTP to HTTPS","version":"0.1.2resigned1","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/4276739/http_to_https-0.1.2resigned1.xpi","homepageURL":"http://add0n.com/http-to-https.html","supportURL":"https://github.com/balvin-perrie/http-to-https","amoListingURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/http-to-https/","description":"Automatically switched to secure HTTP version of webpages if possible.","fullDescription":"An extension to automatically use HTTPS protocol when possible.
